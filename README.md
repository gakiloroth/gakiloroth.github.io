# FGO 3T Simulator

This is a small personal project I'm working on to learn how to do some basic web dev. It's inspired by matekakunai's [FGO Damage Calculator](https://maketakunai.github.io/). 

## Functionality Goals

My goals for this simulator's functionality are to be able to:
- Create and save servants and nickname them
- Create and save enemy nodes and name them
- Go "into" a node to test damage on each wave and simulate NP gain
