# FGO 3T Simulator

This is a small personal project I'm working on to learn how to do some basic web dev. It's inspired by matekakunai's [FGO Damage Calculator](https://maketakunai.github.io/).

## Functionality Goals

With this simulator you will be able to save a servant's stats (with CE), and quest nodes (3 waves of enemies).
Then, you can choose one servant and one quest, and test NP damage and NP refund.

Work in Progress:
- Reimplement party system to test multple servants/nps in one quest
- Ability to use buffs on each wave
- See NP regen per wave
- Automatically choose sky/man/earth attribute for servant
- Buttons to add popular buffs (Waver, Umu Bride, etc.)
