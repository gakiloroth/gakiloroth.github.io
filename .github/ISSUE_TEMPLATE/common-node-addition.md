**Reason for adding**
What this node is used for (what mats it drops, what event its for (lotto or otherwise), **or** any other reason this node will be commonly used)

**Name of the node and Wiki / Atlas Academy Link**
The name of the node you want to add and a link to wiki (https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Fate/Grand_Order_Wikia) or Atlas Academy page (https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars). This is used for the name of the node in the search list, and makes it easier for me to parse the quest info.

**Atlas Academy DB Link**
If you already linked Atlas Academy above, disregard, otherwise:

You can search for the node you wanted added here: https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars, and then simply link the node you want added. (For example this would be the link for the "Extreme Loneliness" node: https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/quest/93030402/3/stage-3). Otherwise, I can find it myself with the given FGO wiki link.
